# Getting Started

> Unified primitives for building and integrating AI coding agents.

`unagent` helps you detect running agents, discover skills, parse sources, and run common workflows with consistent APIs.

## Start Here

- [Install unagent](/guide/installation)
- [Run the quick start](/guide/quick-start)
- [Browse all modules](/modules)
- [See supported agents](/guide/agents)

## What You Can Build

- Detect 40+ AI coding agents by environment or config
- Parse skill files and validate against the agentskills.io spec
- Resolve source strings into GitHub/GitLab/local paths
- Operate on repos with safe cloning and status helpers
- Connect to workflow, sandbox, vector, and queue providers
