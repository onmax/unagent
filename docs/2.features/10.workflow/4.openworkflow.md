# OpenWorkflow

> OpenWorkflow-specific workflow helpers via the `workflow.openworkflow` namespace.

## Usage

### Setup
Start an OpenWorkflow worker in your runtime, then create the client with the OpenWorkflow provider.

```ts [app.ts]
import { createWorkflow } from 'unagent/workflow'
import { onboardingWorkflow } from './workflows/onboarding'

const workflow = await createWorkflow({
  provider: { name: 'openworkflow', workflow: onboardingWorkflow },
})

const openworkflow = workflow.openworkflow
```

::important
OpenWorkflow requires Node.js 20+ and a database backend (Postgres or SQLite). You must run workers yourself.

## API

### OpenWorkflow Namespace
#### workflow

The configured workflow definition:

```ts [app.ts]
const definition = workflow.openworkflow.workflow
```

#### ow

Optional escape hatch for the OpenWorkflow instance if you pass it in provider options:

```ts [app.ts]
const ow = workflow.openworkflow.ow
```

### `result()`

Use `result()` to wait for a workflow run to finish. You can pass `timeoutMs` to control the maximum wait time.

```ts [app.ts]
const run = await workflow.start({ userId: '123' })
const output = await run.result?.({ timeoutMs: 45000 })
```

### `get` Behavior

`workflow.get(id)` is best-effort for OpenWorkflow. If you need it, pass a `getRun` function in provider options.

## Examples

### Example
```ts [app.ts]
const run = await workflow.start({ userId: '123' })
const status = await run.status()

if (status.state === 'running') {
  await run.stop()
}
```
